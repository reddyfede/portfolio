      <p>
        I am a Software Engineer with a background and work experience in
        Industrial Engineering.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my previous job experiences I worked closely with software suppliers
        doing Business Analysis and Quality Assurance to implement new software
        for the factory.
      </p>

      <p>
        This gave me the opportunity to experience the full life cycle of
        software and helped me to always be aware of clientsâ€™ needs.
