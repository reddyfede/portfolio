            <p>I am a Software Engineer with a background and work experience in Industrial Engineering.</p>
            
            <p>In my previous job experiences I worked closely with software suppliers doing Business Analysis and Quality Assurance to implement new software for the factory.</p>
            
            <p>This gave me the opportunity to experience the full life cycle of software and helped me to always be aware of clientsâ€™ needs.</p>
